[1] Opened for the PROLIFIC and MOST NOTABLE Mr. Joe Probst and his bandmates Andy Knapp, and Bruce Wolfe. Jammed with them during their set later that night.
[2] See pictures for rough idea of setlist. All I remember is Joe Probst saying “ooo I like this one” and coming up on stage to jam with me keyboards when I started playing Party N Bullshit (Notorious BIG).
