Show Notes:
I played first and remember feeling bad for having to leave as soon as my set was done, and not being able to watch the bands that invited me to join them for band night, because I had tickets to go see Break Science at the Bluebird. Every Breath You Take wasn’t written on the setlist but I know I played it.
