Show Notes: First of a series shows with my brother in sound and life Troy Michael AKA TRØLL. I had the privilege of sitting in on guitar while TRØLL pumps out Motown, Funk, and R&B classics and blends them with Bass and House music. During this period I enjoyed most was hanging out with Troy and digging through the deep cuts finding songs for him to play. Sometimes we rehearsed or at least knew what songs we were playing, other times I just showed up and plugged in.
