No known setlist.

Show Notes: I played “Birthday Sex” by Jeremih with my Dad because he cancelled his Lil’ 500 concert the day before this. This show is a memorable one for me, so this Show Notes is really going to be a little story… If you read the last post you’ll have noticed I left immediately after my set to go see Break Science at the Bluebird. That was Thursday night, on Saturday night Turkuaz played at the Bluebird as well. Long story short, I didn’t get to sleep until Sunday — during the course of which I had contracted strep throat and a sinus infection. It’s a couple weeks before finals, so I dragged myself to class Monday around noon and got a text saying the Live From Bloomington artist that week cancelled and asked if I could fill in. Things were already so fucked that I figured playing an hour of music couldn’t hurt. I could barely speak let alone sing, but had a blast AND my Dad even came down on a whim and played a few songs with me.
