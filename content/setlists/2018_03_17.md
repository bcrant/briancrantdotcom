“St. Patrick’s Day Party” @ Danny Boy Draft Works IU.

No known setlist.

[1] Both acoustic and electric guitars were played for the first time since 2017-04-18.

Show Notes: I provided and ran the sound system for the four other artists than myself (DJ STAKZILLA, The Jefferson St. Parade Band, The McGuires, The Shenanigan Sisters) that performed at the Danny Boy St. Patrick’s Day extravaganza that began 10am – then I proceeded to close out the night with an 8-10pm set. That day was: particularly long.
