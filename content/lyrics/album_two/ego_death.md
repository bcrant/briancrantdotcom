VERSE 1  
I tried my best... to reach ego death  
Kill it all now... 'til there's no ego left  
Won't you die, ego die... like it says on the pamphlet  
Die ego, die... at the mindfulness bootcamp  
  
VERSE 2  
I won't put in the work... but I'll go for a weekend  
Kill it dead now... or give me a refund  
The only way to grow... is if my ego dies  
You have my full attention... until Sunday at five  
  
INSTRUMENTAL BREAK  
  
VERSE 3  
Got no peace of mind... just pieces â€“ most of the time  
No good at meditation... tried the Calm app twice  
Too many notifications... I'm a very busy guy  
Tried the medications... I need more things to try  
  
VERSE 3  
I dosed the orange juice... drank the orange juice for breakfast  
Everyday for a whole month... ego still like Texas  
I'm making microchanges... and expect macro results  
Tried to microkill my egoo... my ego survived

EXTRAS  
I'd go to a group... if it were all about me  
I'd see a shrink... if they didn't talk about feelings  
  
When I meditate... I hear my ego laughin  
"What are you doing? You can't even sit still in traffic"  
  
Went and bought a sunlamp... still not happy or enlightened
