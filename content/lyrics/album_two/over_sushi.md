## Over Sushi / Sushi's Over
Categories: `ALBUM TWO` `LYRICS`

What does it mean? 
<!-- That when I think about how you are doing, I wonder if I was wrong?
The next thought I have is wondering if I was wrong? -->
That when you cross my mind, even if just for a second,
I find myself wondering if I was wrong?
Did I make a huge mistake?
The grass looked greener, I didn't know that most ice teas need so much sweetener,
I've lost my taste for it
When I snap back to, I am just as confused,


When you cross my mind, even if just for a second,
I can't help but wonder if I was wrong?
Maybe that's not so bad, maybe I just oughta ask,
I just want to know how you are doing
and wonder what you did today?
and ask you all the questions that came up throughout the day
that I would save for dinner
so that I could look at you smile for an hour
over sushi

What does it mean? 
That when I think about how you are doing
I wonder if I was wrong? Did I make a huge mistake?
Is it so wrong to want to know that you're okay?
and wonder what did you do today?
and want to ask you all the questions that came out throughout the day?
that I would save for dinner
so that I could look at you smile for an hour
over sushi

What does it mean? 
That when I think about how you are doing
I wonder if I was wrong? Did I make a huge mistake?
Maybe I just want to know that you're okay? and nothing more?
I just wonder what you did you do today?
and want to ask you all the questions I collected throughout the day
that I would save for dinner
so that I could look at you smile for an hour
over sushi

I wonder that if you were there for me in the beginning
why wasn't I there for you at the end?
Did I run away? Did you push me away?
Did I give up too quick or stay too long?
Maybe it was the tiny apartment and quarantine
Maybe I should have focused on making more friends
Maybe it was the global pandemic
Maybe I should have spent more time with you and less time in therapy
Maybe you would have broke up with me first if I wasn't in therapy
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be...
Maybe we could have dinner again soon?
Maybe I've been saving more questions for you
over sushi

When sushi's over I always want more
Is it because it's convenient? Or familiar? 
Or because I love the tiny lemon slices on the albacore?
Is it because I still feel like I could love you more?
Is it because starting over feels like an upassable mountain?
Or a losing game â€“ where the best I'll ever finish is in second place?
Sushi's over
