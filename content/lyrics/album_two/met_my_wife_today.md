Met My Wife Today

CHORDS
C G C x2 
F G C Am Fm6


VERSE 1  
I met my wife today  
Can't wait til she finds this page  
I'm no fortune teller  
Just a fortunate fella  
I met my wife today  

VERSE 2  
I'll sing her this song one day  
Think I'll wait three or four dates  
By the fifth I'll know for sure  
If this song ends or it keeps going  
I met my wife today  
  
VERSE 3  
I'd stay here all night if you wouldn't leave  
I feel light, I feel like you see me  
Long brown hair in an office chair... Swivelin'  
I'd float away, if not... for your magnetism
