Soulmate Socialist

CHORDS
G#  D#  Cm  C#  G#

VERSE 1
I can't put my finger on it, don't know how to explain
When she talks about socialism, I want to kiss her brain (yeah)

My interest rate is through the roof, soon I'll need to borrow
I'll sell my Richard Marx CDs, and trade them in for Karl

CHORUS
Talking bout my soulmate socialist
Talking bout my soulmate socialist
Talking bout my commie mami (yeah)

VERSE 2
She's not so keen on capitalism, but I can live with that
She makes me feel like a billionaire, but wants profits to be capped

She makes me feel like the one percent
I want to give her my all, but she wants it to go to the government (yeah)

CHORUS

VERSE 3
There were two big red flags, how did I miss them?
One was on her wall, and she didn't like Pulp Fiction

OR

There were two big red flags, I ignored them all
She didn't like Pulp Fiction, the other red flag was on her wall

OR

There were two red flags, but I was enamored and tickled
She didn't like Pulp Fiction, the other red flag featured a hammer and sickle


I want to occupy Mars, she wants to talk about Marx



EXTRAS
<!-- Rewind to last winter, where the story begins
How I met your mother, or one of the ones that could have been

For three months I was love struck, there was one thing I couldn't shake
Actually there were two, she didn't like Pulp Fiction... -->

We don't always see eye to eye, but her and I were a good fit
We don't need to agree on everything, 

have to agree on everything, and I would rather we don't
She makes me
