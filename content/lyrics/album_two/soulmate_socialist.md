VERSE 1
I can't put my finger on it, don't know how to explain
When she talks about socialism, I want to kiss her brain

She's not so keen on capitalism, but I can live with that
She makes me feel like a billionaire, but wants profits to be capped

She makes me feel like the one percent
I want to give her my all, but she wants it to go to the government

My interest rate is through the roof
It wont' be long until I'll need to borrow
I'll sell my Richard Marx CDs
and trade them in for Karl

I want to occupy Mars, she wants to talk about Marx
