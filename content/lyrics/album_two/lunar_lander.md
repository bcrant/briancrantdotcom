Lunar Lander

VERSE 1
Eb5         D/Ebmaj7     Cmin11  A#5    G#
She's got a heart that I want to explore
Park my Lunar Lander right on her aorta

She's got a heart that was born for adventure
Drop my Mars Rover right on her left ventricle

PRE CHORUS
A#          
So much surface, so little time
G#
I'm gonna orbit her heart til it knows that it's mine
A#                                     G#
orbit her heart til it knows that it's mine

CHORUS
       Eb5        D/Ebmaj7          Cmin11        A#5  !! Fm !!
(Yeah) I want her heart to fill the whole night's sky
G#
show the world what her love feels like

VERSE 2
She's got a heart that's as warm as a cardigan
I want to cozy on up next to her pericardium

She's got a heart that can love every part of me
My good and my bad in her pulmonary artery 

PRE CHORUS
So much surface, so little time
I'm gonna X-Ray her heart with my moon satellite
X-Ray her heart with my moon satellite

CHORUS
I want her heart to fill the whole night's sky
show the world what her love feels like

VERSE 3
She’s got a heart like John Hancock’s signature
She’s Intergalactic Shampoo and the Human Conditioner

She's got a heart-of-gold and a smile to melt
She's the only gem you can't find in the asteroid belt

BRIDGE
She's out of this world, I try to keep up
She calls me buzz lightyear when she wants my love
calls me buzz lightyear when she wants my love

CHORUS
I want her heart to fill the whole night's sky
and show the world what her love feels like

VERSE 4
She's got a heart that I want to explore
Park my Lunar Lander right on her aorta

She's got a heart that can love every part of me
My day and my night in her pulmonary artery

PRE CHORUS
So much surface, so little time
I'm gonna orbit her heart til it knows that it's mine
orbit her heart til it knows that it's mine

CHORUS
I want her heart to fill the whole night's sky
show the world what her love feels like



















EXTRAS / SCRATCH
She's got a heart like a magnet and I am a fridge, 
I want to hang out here like a kid's art – for a long time

She's got a heart like a lightning bug
She calls me buzz lightyear when she wants my love

She's got a heart that can sense when I'm missing her
She's Intergalactic Shampoo and the Human Conditioner

She's got a heart that could cleanse John Dillinger
She's Intergalactic Shampoo and the Human Conditioner

I want to live in a cabin but I fucking hate bugs
She calls me buzz lightyear when she wants my love
She's got a friend in me
I won her heart in the lottery 

She's out of this world, I'm head over heels
Even in Zero G, she's got a heart that will pull you in

She bends the space time continuum at her will
She makes time stop when she has time to kill
