Don't Rain Much  
  
CHORDS  
Verse:  Em  Gb G Gb  
Chorus: C walk down to Gb walk up to C  
  
  
VERSE 1  
It don't rain much, but when it do  
It teleports my mood  
It don't rain much, but when it does  
All my feelings flood  
All my dirt is mud  
A mess I can't sweep up  
  
It don't rain much, but when it do  
Good time to vaccuum, bad time to sweep  
It don't rain much, but when it does  
All my feelings creep  
All my mud is deep  
I begin to sink  
  
CHORUS  
Fall, fall back again  
Take back your sky water  
Have back your clouds  
We're already drowning  
Don't need your help  
We got floaties and boats  
Don't need your wetssss...  
  
VERSE 2  
What if heaven gets to heavy  
and falls down on our cities  
All the dead people are living  
Would they visit their own graves?  
Can we reclaim that space?  
It don't rain much, but when it do  
These are the things I think  
It don't rain much, but when it does  
Heaven's going down  
and rent is going up  
  
CHORUS  

VERSE 3  
Can't write songs full of details  
Everything's mundane  
Every word is somebody's brand name  
Can't afford a name brand  
Can't find a mom & pop shop in a 10 mile radius  
Everything feels stupid  
not a hero to be found  
no saints to annoint  
I've lost the plot and now I've lost the point  
Can't afford to take a stand  
Here I sit at my desk  
Who's gonna clean up this mess  


EXTRAS  
The clouds are fucking crying  
Grown man boy child whining
