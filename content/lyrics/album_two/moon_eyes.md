Moon Eyes  
  
  
VERSE 1  
While most people's eyes   
\[are\] slowly opening up in bed   
I'm already on my fourth cigarette  
  
From my stoop I waved  
as the trash man came  
It's nice to know I'm not alone  
yes there's one more soul awake  
  
PRECHORUS  
Oooh I haven't slept a wink  
So tired I'm scared to blink  
Leave all the windows open  
so the cold breeze... keeps me going  
  
CHORUS  
One step on the sunrise  
Too tired to notice  
Got the shine in my moon eyes  
Whatever keeps me going
