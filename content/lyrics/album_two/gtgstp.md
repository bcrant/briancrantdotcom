VERSE 1  
You don't want the President to be visting you  
You don't want the President to be visting you  
  
If you go to the moon  
when you get back... gtgstp  
If you win the super bowl  
after the parade... gtgstp  
If you make it through the playoffs, then win game seven...  
after you cut down the net then... gtgstp  
If you land a 747 in the Hudson River... still gtgstp  
Gotta go...  
Gotta go see the President  
  
  
CHORUS  
And when you finally, finally meet her  
She says "I'm so sorry, I'm late for my ext meeting"  
President gotta go...  
You gotta go see the President  
  
VERSE 2  
If you discover the fourth neutrino  
(that's the thing that scientist believe may occupy the space that isn't dark matter in the universe)  
Still gotta go see the President  
If you rap album wins a Pulitzer Prize... Kendrick gtgsp  
If you convince multiple generations to protect the environment... Greta gtgsp  
If you cure cancer...  
If you grow a human heart from a stem cell...  
If you invent carbon free concrete...  
Still gotta go see the President  
  
You don't want the President to be visiting you, no...  
Guarantee that somebody you know just lost someone that they love  
You don't want the President to be visiting you, no...  
Guarantee that there's still shells on the ground  
You don't want the President to be visiting you, no...  
Name and age, data points  
Graves, grief, and hollow points  
You don't want the President to be visiting you, no...  
  
If the President is visiting you...  
it's too late
