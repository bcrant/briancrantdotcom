Soulmate Socialist

CHORDS
G#  D#  Cm  C#  G#

VERSE 1
I can't put my finger on it, don't know how to explain
When she talks about socialism, I want to kiss her brain

We don't always have to agree, we can understand in time
When she talks about socialism, I want to kiss her mind
<!-- OR -->
We don't always have to agree, I just want to understand
When she talks about socialism, I want to kiss her pants

CHORUS
Talking bout my soulmate socialist
Talking bout my soulmate socialist
She's my commie mami (yeeaah)

VERSE 2
She's not so keen on capitalism, but I can live with that
She makes me feel like a billionaire, but she wants profits to be capped

She's kind, caring, and fiery, I'm burnt to a crisp
I want to give her my all, but she wants it to go to the government

CHORUS

VERSE 3
For three months last winter, she was exactly what I needed
She left her Marx on me, but the free market remains undefeated
<!-- OR -->
She mended my heart, but the free market remains undefeated

There were two red flags, I tried to dismiss them
<!-- OR -->
There were two red flags, it was hard to admit them
One was on her wall, and she didn't like Pulp Fiction




EXTRAS
My interest rate is through the roof, soon I'll need to borrow
I'll sell my Richard Marx CDs, and trade them in for Karl

She makes me feel like the one percent, but wants it to go to the government

I want to occupy Mars, she wants to talk about Marx

There were two big red flags, I ignored them all
She didn't like Pulp Fiction, the other red flag was on her wall

There were two red flags, but I was enamored and tickled
She didn't like Pulp Fiction, the other red flag featured a hammer and sickle

There were two big red flags, how did I miss them?
There were two big red flags, it took time to admit them
There were two big red flags, but I dismissed them


Rewind to last winter, where the story begins
How I met your mother, or one of the ones that could have been

We don't always see eye to eye, but her and I were a good fit
We don't need to agree on everything, 

have to agree on everything, and I would rather we don't
She makes me

She didn't change my mind about economic systems
She didn't change my stance on the superior economic system
She's out of the picture now, the free market didn't permit it 
She mended my heart, but the free market 

She mended my heart, she was exactly what I needed
For a moment in time, she was exactly what I needed
