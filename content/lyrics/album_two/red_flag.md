Red Flag

CHORDS
G#  D#  Cm  C#  G#

VERSE 1
I can't put my finger on it, don't know how to explain
When she talks about socialism, I want to kiss her brain (yeeaah)

We don't always have to agree, this is one of those times
When she talks about socialism, I want to kiss her mind 

CHORUS
Talking bout my soulmate socialist
My socialist soulmate 
Talking bout my soulmate socialist
My commie mami (yeeaah)

VERSE 2
She's not so keen on capitalism, but I can live with that
She makes me feel like a billionaire, but she wants profits to be capped

She's kind, caring, and fiery, I'm burnt to a crisp
I want to give her my all, but she wants it to go to the government

CHORUS

VERSE 3
For three months last winter, she was exactly what I needed
She left her Marx on me, but the free market remains undefeated

There were two red flags, I was quick to dismiss them
One was on her wall, and she didn't like Pulp Fiction

CHORUS
