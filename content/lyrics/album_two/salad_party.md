VERSE 1  
Dumb dumb spoke and what he said wasn't dumb  
but he's the last one on earth she wants to hear this from  
"Don't start over thinking things, nothing good ever comes from that.  
It's your only day off this week, enjoy the time in your garden.  
It's a beautiful afternoon and the tom•a•toes need harvest."  
  
Dumb dumb was correct, the sun was out  
but dumb dumb doesn't know when to shut his mouth  
"Don't let your mind stomp on sour grapes, the garden is no place to ruminate.  
Don't dirty up your mind with people, places, and things,  
or me, or words that I said in 2014."  
  
Dumb dumb really done dug himself a deep hole this tiiiime, yeeee•aaaa  
Fill up your basket with the vegetables you've grown,  
and when he gets home, you can have a salad party,  
or you can have a lot of tomatoes to throw...  
  
PRE CHORUS  
You gotta water those plants  
You gotta plant more seeds  
You gotta get out of your house  
And tend to your garden  
And then you gotta leave it alone  
  
CHORUS  
And let the sun do its part  
And let the earth do its part  
And let time do its part  
The garden is a place where you can only do the things you control  
the things you control  
  
VERSE 2  
Well a salad party sounds like a whole lot of fun  
But she can't stop thinkin' 'bout what he done done  
She's really gonna show him this tiiiime, yeeee•aaaa  
She's got the fury of nations, a half dozen roma tomatoes,  
She's been practicing her aim -  
with a bottle on a tree stump  
She's gonna hit him right between the eyes, yeeee•aaaa  
  
Dumb dumb's got another thing coming  
she's gonna make him one saucy pizza pie  
or some au naturel ketchup bullshit -  
from the healthy foods aisle  
All that mess, or you could take ten breathes,  
go to your garden and put all that behind ya...  
NO NO she said dumb dumb's gonna pay, yeeee•aaaa  
  
PRE CHORUS  
You gotta water those plants  
You gotta plant more seeds  
You gotta get out of your house  
And tend to your garden  
And then you gotta leave it alone...  
  
CHORUS  
And let the sun do its part  
And let the earth do its part  
And let time do its part  
The garden is a place where you can only do the things you control  
the things you control...

REPRISE  
She's gonna throw it all away (at the salad party)  
She's gonna hit him in the face (at the salad party)  
She's gonna throw it all away (at the salad party)  
She's gonna hit him in the face (at the salad party)  
There's no tomatoes to eat (at the salad party)
