## Turtle Shell

I’d do it for you if it’d help, but girl 
You got to do this yourself
I’d hear them for you, all on my own
I’d die trying for them to leave you alone

I’ll show your demons apart from yourself
You’re always covered in my turtle shell
I’ll hide you well

You won’t have to hear their voices no more, even if they yell
I won’t ever let them reach you in my turtle shell

I’ll show your demons apart from yourself
You’re always covered in my turtle shell
I’ll hide you well

Always got your back, turtle shell has mine
Always got your back, you don’t have to hide
Always got your back, turtle shell has mine
Always got your back, ‘til long after we die
