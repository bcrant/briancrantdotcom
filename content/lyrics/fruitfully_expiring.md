## Fruitfully Expiring
Categories: `LIFE IS WEIRD` `LYRICS`

Step outside and I hear sirens
I think to myself inside that
Help is on its way
You might need help to find it

Only a fool trips on what’s behind them
Only a fool trips on what’s behind them

Can’t deny it, we’re already dying
There’s an end to all
All is just a matter of time then

Only a fool trips on what’s behind them
Only a fool trips on what’s behind them

I don’t mind the brown spots on my bananas
That’s time I could have been
Fruitfully expiring
That’s time I could have been
Fruitfully expiring

It’s hard to watch you going too fast to leave anything behind you
No signs of slowing down, you’ll be just as fast forgotten
Is it the same to you to be expired as it is fruitfully expiring?

I don’t mind the brown spots on my bananas
That’s time I could have been
Fruitfully expiring
That’s time I could have been
Fruitfully expiring
