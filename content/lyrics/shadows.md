## Shadows

Quit trying to outrun your shadow
You know that it’s mid-day
It sticks with you
Even with the sun sets it’s all the same:
“Boy, you don’t change”
You don’t change, she said

But to each day rise with a smile
Hold your head for a little while
Make your moves boy make your moves
When the sun sets you’ll see
Change is only what you used to be
Don’t go hiding away

She said, “Don’t go hiding away”
Don’t go hiding away
