## Damned If You Do

High highs and low lows
No I don’t fit in between those
That middle ground is too much space – for me
Right at the edge, that’s where I do best
See none and all, ain’t all that different 

It’s strange how things are changing
But I feel in the right place this time
With you I’ve found that lately I don’t
Need these things to feel alright but still I...

T-t-t-tip a bottle up and stay out
Then pray the sun will stay down
day in, day out the same; beyond my control
oooh the things that I would do
to move my edge away from you

And undo these wrongs, both yours and mine
I’ll feel better, if you’d slip my mind – slip my mind

It’s strange how things are changing
But I feel in the right place this time.
With you I’ve found that lately I don’t
Need these things to feel alright

Damned if you do, damned if you don’t
But then we won’t know
until we’ve grown old
