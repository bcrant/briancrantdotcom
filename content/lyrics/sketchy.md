## Sketchy
Categories: `LIFE IS WEIRD` `LYRICS`
  
Started out sketchy  
Told her do one thing: forget me  
Said she want a man  
But she don’t know what she’s gettin’ in  
  
She could be the craziest of the crazy  
And still not hold a candle  
  
Don’t get too close  
Don’t get too close  
Sketchy by design  
Baby that’s no fault of mine  
  
She don’t even know sketchy  
You’re looking in the mirror flexing baby  
She thinks she’s tough  
But she don’t know when she’s had enough  
  
She could make mistakes as long the day is  
And come out sacred  
  
Don’t get too close  
Don’t get too close  
Sketchy by design  
Baby that’s no fault of mine
