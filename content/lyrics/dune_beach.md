## Dune Beach
Categories: `LIFE IS WEIRD` `LYRICS`
  
Quick sand on Dune Beach  
Slide down a little further  
Knee deep in numb creek  
Can’t keep my head above the water  
  
Quick sand on Dune Beach  
Slide past the things I’ve wanted  
Knee deep in numb creek  
Can’t keep my fingers on the off switch  
  
Just a little wet I’ll be drowning by tomorrow  
Just a little bit and I won’t be around to follow  
  
Quick sand on Dune Beach  
Slide down a little further  
Knee deep in numb creek  
Can’t keep my head above the water  
  
Quick sand on Dune Beach  
Slide past the things I’ve wanted  
Knee deep in numb creek  
Can’t keep my fingers on the off switch  
  
Just a little wet I’ll be drowning by tomorrow  
Just a little bit and I won’t be around to follow  
  
Most don’t drift in the low tide  
Baby I’m just more the ‘more’ type  
If my toes get wet I’ll be up to my neck  
And sink into the sand  
Drop anchor on land or find air underneath  
Knee deep in numb creek  
  
Just a little wet I’ll be drowning by tomorrow  
Just a little sip and I won’t be around to
