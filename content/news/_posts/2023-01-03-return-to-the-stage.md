I will be playing at [Elevate Coffee Co.](https://www.elevatecoffee.com/) from 7-9pm this Friday, January 6th, 2023! Coffee will be flowing and there will be a full moon that night, optimal conditions for a highly charged return to the stage ⚡️

My last proper two hour set was in 2019. Time flies when you’re having….

Like and subscribe if you think I should post a blog about my feelings afterwards!! There are still plenty of vinyl and CD copies of Life is Weird available [in my shop](https://briancrant.com/shop/) if you’re interested.
