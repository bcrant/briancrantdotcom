Following an initial three-day run in the recording studio this past July, a second set of sessions for “Life Is Weird” will be underway August 20th-22nd. I’m taking a little break from performing after [last night’s show](https://briancrant.com/setlists) at LaSalle Kitchen & Tavern. Huge thank you to all who came out, I am filled with love and excited to channel that energy in the studio.

In anticipation of my upcoming album, I’ve created accounts for my solo music on all major social media platforms where I’ll be sharing updates from the recording studio and giving subscribers sneak-peaks and early access to singles off the album! More on that soon… stay tuned @bcrantmusic social media channels for details. Thank you for following along and supporting what I love to do!

Jam On,  
Brian
