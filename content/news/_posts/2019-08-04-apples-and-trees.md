I have been very blessed in this life to have a father that has supported and encouraged me to play music, but also one that I can jam with. My dad, a professor by day and humble shredder by night, began teaching me guitar when I was around eight or nine years old.

My dad started playing at a young age himself, albeit, (as I am often reminded) he did not have the luxury of the internet to assist him learning Jimmy Page‚Äôs solos. He sat in front of the record player, repeatedly moving the needle back as he listened to Led Zeppelin albums at half speed to learn the songs note by note. Once he got to high school, he found some other kids that liked sitting in front of record players, and they formed a band together not long after. They called themselves Airhead.

One of the great joys in my life has been connecting with my dad through our shared love of music. I‚Äôve invited him to join me on stage on several occasions over the years at some of my solo gigs and open mics.

The way I see it, there are not many things cooler than being able to invite your dad on stage to jam with you. 

Well, it got cooler.

I just got back from a ~22 hour visit to Orlando for my dad‚Äôs 40th high school anniversary celebration. Remember his band I told you about? Airhead? [Here are some alternate band names I have just come up with] The Analog Assassins? The 33rpm Banditos? The Pre-Walkmann Brothers Band? Airhead played together for the first time since 1979 last night‚Äì and I flew out to play a song with them.

It was so glorious. My whole life I‚Äôve heard about how great they were from my father. Low and behold, he wasn‚Äôt kidding. They absolutely rip! Getting to join them on stage to play Tom Petty‚Äôs ‚ÄúMary Jane‚Äôs Last Dance‚Äù was a magical moment in time. I felt like everything came full circle, as I was surrounded by the people who fostered my dad‚Äôs love of music when he was growing up, just as he did mine. I can only hope to age as gray-cefully as they have üôÇ

Be sure to [follow my page](https://www.instagram.com/bcrantmusic/) while you‚Äôre at it and be the first to hear new music from me! And not at all for other reasons, like getting enough followers for @Lab Series to start sending me their Multi-Action Facewash so that I can spread the good word of Lab Series via my pores, which speaking of poor, could also benefit greatly from another tube of Cooling Shave Cream. But smash that follow button for the music! Very important.

With Peace, Love, and Hope for the Future,
Brian
