    <h4>APPLES AND TREES</h4>
    
    
    
    <p>August 4th, 2019</p>
    
    
    
    <p>I have been very blessed in this life to have a father that has supported and encouraged me to play music, but also one that I can jam with. My dad, a professor by day and humble shredder by night, began teaching me guitar when I was around eight or nine years old.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>My dad started playing at a young age himself, albeit, (as I am often reminded) he did not have the luxury of the internet to assist him learning Jimmy Page‚Äôs solos. He sat in front of the record player, repeatedly moving the needle back as he listened to Led Zeppelin albums at half speed to learn the songs note by note. Once he got to high school, he found some other kids that liked sitting in front of record players, and they formed a band together not long after. They called themselves Airhead.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>One of the great joys in my life has been connecting with my dad through our shared love of music. I‚Äôve invited him to join me on stage on several occasions over the years at some of my solo gigs and open mics.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>There‚Äôs not much cooler than‚Äì with the exception of maybe, oh, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶</p>
    
    
    
    <p>being proactive about minimizing your reliance on plastic products; smiling whenever possible to empower those around you to do the same; and striving for mutual understanding and respect for those with whom you disagree</p>
    
    
    
    <p>‚Ä¶the way I see it, there is not much cooler than being able to invite your dad on stage to jam with you. Well, it got cooler.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>I just got back from a ~22 hour visit to Orlando for my dad‚Äôs 40th high school anniversary celebration. Remember his band I told you about? Airhead? [Here are some alternate band names I have just come up with] The Analog Assassins? The 33rpm Banditos? The Pre-Walkmann Brothers Band? Airhead played together for the first time since 1979 last night‚Äì and I flew out to play a song with them.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>It was so glorious. My whole life I‚Äôve heard about how great they were from my father. Low and behold, he wasn‚Äôt kidding. They absolutely rip! Getting to join them on stage to play Tom Petty‚Äôs <em>‚ÄúMary Jane‚Äôs Last Dance‚Äù</em> was a magical&nbsp; moment in time. I felt like everything came full circle, as I was surrounded by the people who fostered my dad‚Äôs love of music when he was growing up, just as he did mine. I can only hope to age as gray-cefully as they have üôÇ</p>

    <p>Be sure to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bcrantmusic/">follow my page</a> while you‚Äôre at it and be the first to hear new music from me! And not at all for other reasons, like getting enough followers for @Lab Series to start sending me their Multi-Action Facewash so that I can spread the good word of Lab Series via my pores, which speaking of poor, could also benefit greatly from another tube of Cooling Shave Cream. But smash that follow button for the music! Very important.&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>PROGRESS REPORT</h4>
    
    
    
    <p>September 27th, 2018</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The second recording session went well and I‚Äôm pleased to report that the album is nearing its final stages. Once I get all of the mixes back I‚Äôm going to sit on them for a couple of months and listen to them on a variety of speakers ‚Äì including my car, it has sound good in my car and it has to sound good in your car ‚Äì to make sure there are no changes I want to make before I send it off to get mastered. From there, I‚Äôll repeat the listening step. It has to pass the car test, so if you want to listen to my album in your car shoot me a <a href="https://briancrant.com/contact/">message here</a> or on the Brian Crant Music&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bcrantmusic">Facebook page</a>.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Looking forward to sharing this with you all. Take care of yourselves, I‚Äôll talk to you soon. And don‚Äôt forget to call your Mom and tell her that you love her every now and then. Be well.</p>

    <h4>BACK TO THE LAB AGAIN!<del></del></h4>
    
    
    
    <p>August 4th, 2018</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Following an initial three-day run in the recording studio this past July, a second set of sessions for ‚ÄúLife Is Weird‚Äù will be underway&nbsp;August 20th-22nd. I‚Äôm taking a little break from performing after <a href="https://briancrant.com/setlists">last night‚Äôs show</a> at LaSalle Kitchen &amp; Tavern. Huge thank you to all who came out, I am filled with love and excited to channel that energy in the studio.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>In anticipation of my upcoming&nbsp;album, I‚Äôve created accounts for my solo music on all major social media platforms where I‚Äôll be sharing updates from the recording studio and giving subscribers sneak-peaks &amp; early access to singles off the album! More on that soon‚Ä¶ stay tuned&nbsp;@bcrantmusic social media channels for details.&nbsp;Thank you for following along and supporting what I love to do!</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Jam On,<br>Brian</p>
