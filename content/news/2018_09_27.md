## PROGRESS REPORT

September 27th, 2018

The second recording session went well and I’m pleased to report that the album is nearing its final stages. Once I get all of the mixes back I’m going to sit on them for a couple of months and listen to them on a variety of speakers – including my car, it has sound good in my car and it has to sound good in your car – to make sure there are no changes I want to make before I send it off to get mastered. From there, I’ll repeat the listening step. It has to pass the car test, so if you want to listen to my album in your car shoot me a [message here](https://briancrant.com/contact/) or on the [Brian Crant Music Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bcrantmusic).

Looking forward to sharing this with you all. Take care of yourselves, I’ll talk to you soon. And don’t forget to call your Mom and tell her that you love her every now and then. Be well.

-Brian
