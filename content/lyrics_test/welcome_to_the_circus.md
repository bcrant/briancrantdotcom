## Welcome to the Circus
Categories: `LIFE IS WEIRD` `LYRICS`

Finally got my affairs in order 
Got my affairs in order… well, sort of
My world and yours 
My world is yours... well, sort of
From inside the borders 
We can choose to -
We can still move forwards

To have all of today, all of today 
And still want some more of
Tomorrows before us
My world and yours
My world is yours… well, sort of
Only if the sun will rise the next
And we forget on both sides of the fence
We’re all on the same side I guess… well, sort of
At least on the surface
So seek out your purpose and 
Smile along the way, smile along the way
Welcome to the circus


Life is so weird, as is
Just look around we’re living proof
Why build a wall without a roof?
Why be born at all if there’s no room?
Can’t our clown car fit a few? 
There’s space for me and you
Welcome to the circus
Life is so weird, as is
No doubts about it
